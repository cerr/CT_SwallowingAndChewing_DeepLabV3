# CT_SwallowingAndChewing_DeepLabV3

This repository contains pre-trained models and code for deep learning-based autosegmentation of swallowing and chewing structures viz. masseters (left and right),
medial pterygoids (left and right), larynx, and pharyngeal constrictor muscle. A Colab notebook [demo_DLseg_swallowing_and_chewing_structures.ipynb](https://github.com/cerr/CT_SwallowingAndChewing_DeepLabV3/blob/master/demo_DLseg_swallowing_and_chewing_structures.ipynb) is provided to demonstrate usage.

Commercial Use, and (iii) Dual Licensing which reserve the right to diverge and/or modify and/or expand the model implementations library to have a closed
source/proprietary version along with the open source version in future. It should be noted that the segmentation models are distributed strictly for research use. Clinical

provides implementations of the developed models, whereas the creators of models retain the copyright to their work.
