# CT_SwallowingAndChewing_DeepLabV3

This repository contains pre-trained models and code for deep learning-based autosegmentation of swallowing and chewing structures viz. masseters (left and right),
medial pterygoids (left and right), larynx, and pharyngeal constrictor muscle. A Colab notebook [demo_DLseg_swallowing_and_chewing_structures.ipynb](https://github.com/cerr/CT_SwallowingAndChewing_DeepLabV3/blob/master/demo_DLseg_swallowing_and_chewing_structures.ipynb) is provided to demonstrate usage.

Commercial Use, and (iii) Dual Licensing which reserve the right to diverge and/or modify and/or expand the model implementations library to have a closed
source/proprietary version along with the open source version in future. It should be noted that the segmentation models are distributed strictly for research use. Clinical
